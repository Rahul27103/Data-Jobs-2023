# The Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python) which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions

Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

### Note

India is set as the default location, focusing on the top three selected job titles. You can modify the script to change the country and adjust variables as needed.

### 1. In-Demand Skills

What are the most frequently requested skills for the top job titles in the data sector?
### 2. Skills and Compensation

What is the correlation between specific skills and compensation levels?
### 3. Optimal Skills

Which skills should be prioritized for learning based on demand and compensation?
### 5. Top Employers

Who are the leading employers for data professionals in India?

# Tools I Used

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Filter India Jobs

To focus my analysis on the India job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the India.

```python
selected_country='India'
df_sel=df[df['job_country']==selected_country]
```

# The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [Skill Demand Analysis](2_Skill_Demand.ipynb).

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(no_of_title,1)
fig.set_size_inches((10, no_of_title*2))
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
for i,title in enumerate(title_list):
    df_plot=df_skill_per[df_skill_per['job_title_short']==title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot,x='skill_per',y='job_skills',ax=ax[i],hue='skill_per',legend=False)
    ax[i].set_title(title)
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlim(0,80)

    if i != len(title_list) -1: # for removing x-label
        ax[i].set_xticks([])

    for n,v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_per']): # showing data points in chart
        ax[i].text(v+1,n,f"{v:.0f}%", va='center')

fig.suptitle(f'Percentage of Skills Requested in {selected_country} Job Postings', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=0.5) # fix the overlap
plt.show()
```

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [Salary Analysis](3_Salary_Analysis.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data 

```python
fig , ax = plt.subplots(2,1)

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.barplot(data=df_skill_pay,x='median',y=df_skill_pay.index,hue='median',ax=ax[0],legend=False)
ax[0].set_title(f'Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts in the {selected_country}')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))


sns.barplot(data=df_skills_top,x='median',y=df_skills_top.index,hue='median',ax=ax[1],legend=False)
ax[1].set_title(f'Highest In Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the {selected_country}')
ax[1].set_ylabel('')
ax[1].set_xlabel('')
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

plt.tight_layout()

In contrast, Data Analysts have the lowest median salary, although a few outliers indicate that some Data Analysts earn significantly more than the majority.


### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

#### Visualize Data

```python
fig , ax = plt.subplots(2,1)

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.barplot(data=df_skill_pay,x='median',y=df_skill_pay.index,hue='median',ax=ax[0],legend=False)
ax[0].set_title(f'Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts in the {selected_country}')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))


sns.barplot(data=df_skills_top,x='median',y=df_skills_top.index,hue='median',ax=ax[1],legend=False)
ax[1].set_title(f'Highest In Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the {selected_country}')
ax[1].set_ylabel('')
ax[1].set_xlabel('')
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

#### Results

## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn ( the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [Optimal Skill](4_Optimal_Skill.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data

```python
f_plot=df_skill_pay[df_skill_pay['skill_per']>5]

sns.scatterplot(data=df_plot,y='median',x='skill_per')
plt.xlabel('Percent of Data Analyst Jobs')
plt.ylabel('Median Salary ($USD)')  # Assuming this is the label you want for y-axis
plt.title('Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the India')
```

To Identify the leading employers I will plot Top Employer by No of Job posting and Top Employer by Median Salary Offered.

### Visualizing Data of Leader by Scatter Plot

```python 
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.barplot(data=df_plot1,x='count',y='company_name',hue='count',legend=False)
sns.despine()
plt.xlabel("No. of Jobs")
plt.ylabel("")
plt.title(f"Number of Jobs for {selected_title} in Top Companies Across {selected_country}")
```
Code for Median Salaries Plot
```python
df_plot=df_sel.dropna(subset='salary_year_avg')
df_plot=df_plot.groupby('company_name')['salary_year_avg'].agg(['count','median']).sort_values(by='median',ascending=False).head(15)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.barplot(data=df_plot,x='median',y='company_name')
sns.despine()
plt.xlabel("Median Salary")
plt.ylabel("")
plt.title(f"Median Salaries for {selected_title} in Top Companies Across {selected_country}")
